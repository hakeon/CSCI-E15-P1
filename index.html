				<h4>Who is Brad and Why is He Taking This Course</h3>
					<p>When not enjoying coding far too late into the night for an old working man, Brad enjoys his home and family 
					in far west Massachusetts.  How far west you ask?  Well, far enough that he suffers throngs of Yankee fans each summer and fall.
					When he's not enjoying his family (directly) or suffering Yankee fans (actually) he works as a Physical Therapist at a long-term
					rehabilitation facility.  He is taking this course, along with CS50, as the 2nd and 3rd prerequisites to apply to the ALM program
					in Media Design or whatever it is called... Web Design and Development, basically.</p>
				<h4>Programming Experience, OS, and Other Stuff</h4>
					<p>Brad took CSCI E-12 last spring, and a whole pot full of self-taught, MOOCs, and college courses for what seems like decades...
						but is really just a few years.  In essence, he is old enough to seriously think about retirement - and realizing that he can't...
						So, if he has to work, he might as well do something fun, something interesting, something somewhat flexible in geography, and pays
						pretty well for the effort... and programming fits the bill.
					</p>
					<p>BTW: He codes on Mac</p>
